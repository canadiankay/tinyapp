# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (similar to Bit.ly)

## Final Product

!["This is the login page, where a user can also access the register page if they do not already have an account. A user will only be able to access TinyApp once they have created an account and are logged in."](https://github.com/canadiankay/tinyapp/blob/master/docs/urls-login.png?raw=true)

!["This is the page that a user will first see once they are logged in. It will show all of the long URLs they have shorted. Note, if a user has just created an account, this page will be blank."](https://github.com/canadiankay/tinyapp/blob/master/docs/urls.png?raw=true)


!["This is the page that an individual will be met with, either once they have created a shortURL, or if they try to edit the longURL associated with their shortURL."](https://github.com/canadiankay/tinyapp/blob/master/docs/urls-short-longurl.png)
